## 🌟 What's New in v2.1.2

### 🧠 **Context-Resilient Development**
- **Context Management**: Full state preservation across IDE context clears
- **Seamless Continuation**: Use `/clear` anytime - agents resume exactly where you left off
- **State-Based Recovery**: Complete development history preserved in file system
- **Zero Context Dependency**: All workflow state independent of IDE context

## 🌟 Previous Features (v2.1.0)

### 🎯 **Independent Agent Mode**
- **Direct Agent Access**: Call any agent directly for specific tasks (`@ui-agent`, `@cubit-agent`, etc.)
- **Smart Feature Detection**: Agents automatically find related features to update
- **Lightweight Tracking**: Full progress tracking without workflow overhead
- **Seamless Escalation**: Automatic upgrade to full workflow when complexity requires it

### 🧠 **Intelligent Agent Coordination**
- **Advanced Parallel Execution**: UI+Domain and Security+Test agents run simultaneously
- **Dynamic Conflict Resolution**: Automatic detection and resolution of agent conflicts
- **Event-Driven Coordination**: Real-time agent communication and handoff optimization
- **Resource Load Balancing**: Intelligent allocation of system resources

### 🛡️ **Crash Recovery & State Management**
- **100% Crash Recovery**: Never lose progress due to IDE crashes or interruptions
- **Automatic State Preservation**: Continuous backup every 5 minutes with zero data loss
- **Recovery Checkpoints**: Manual and automatic checkpoint creation at critical phases
- **State Validation**: Comprehensive integrity checking and corruption detection

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g @appiq/flutter-workflow
```

### Option 1: Independent Agent Usage (NEW!)

Work directly with any agent for specific tasks:

```bash
# UI improvements
@ui-agent "Make the login screen more modern and add dark mode support"

# State management updates  
@cubit-agent "Add loading states and better error handling to the user profile"

# Domain logic enhancements
@domain-agent "Add validation rules for user registration"
```

**Agent will automatically:**
1. 🔍 Find related features in your project
2. 🎯 Offer appropriate approach (standalone, feature update, or full workflow)
3. 📊 Track all work with complete history
4. 🔄 Coordinate with other agents when needed

### Option 2: Full Workflow Mode

For complete feature development:

```bash
# Initialize workflow system
npx @appiq/flutter-workflow install

# Create new feature
npx @appiq/flutter-workflow create-feature user-authentication

# Start feature development with FeatureMaster
@feature-manager "Start development for user-authentication feature"
```

## 🧠 Context Management & State Preservation

### 🔄 **Context-Resilient Development**

The Appiq Flutter Workflow is completely **context-independent** - you can use `/clear` anytime without losing progress!

#### **Why This Matters:**
When IDE context gets full (~25% remaining), you can safely clear it:

```bash
# When context gets low:
/clear

# Immediately continue exactly where you left off:
@ui-agent "Continue work on user-authentication feature"

# Agent responds with full context awareness:
"🎨 Hi! I see you're working on user-authentication. 
Status: 65% complete, UI-Phase active.
Last activity: Login screen responsive design
Next step: Dark mode implementation
Shall I continue from there?"
```

#### **How State Preservation Works:**

### 📊 **Automatic State Management**
- **Every 5 minutes**: Automatic state backup
- **At major milestones**: Recovery checkpoints
- **All agent activities**: Logged in permanent files
- **Complete history**: Never lost, always accessible

### 💾 **State Files Structure**
```
docs/
├── features/
│   ├── my-feature.md              # Current status & progress
│   ├── my-feature_state.json      # Complete state backup
│   └── feature-template.md        # Template for new features
├── tasks/
│   ├── my-feature_tasks.md        # Task breakdown & assignments
│   └── my-feature_history.md      # Complete development history
└── independent-sessions/
    ├── ui-agent_12345.json        # Active sessions
    └── activity-log.json          # Central activity log
```

### 🔄 **Context Recovery Commands**

#### **Immediate Recovery:**
```bash
# After /clear, agents automatically restore from:
@feature-manager "*restore-state my-feature"
@ui-agent "*find-related-feature user-authentication" 
@cubit-agent "*continue-previous-work"
```

#### **Manual State Operations:**
```bash
# Save current state manually
@feature-manager "*save-state my-feature"

# Check system health
@feature-manager "*health-check my-feature"

# Create recovery checkpoint
@feature-manager "*create-checkpoint my-feature"

# Restore from specific checkpoint
@feature-manager "*restore-state my-feature checkpoint_123"
```

### 🎯 **Best Practices for Context Management**

#### **🟢 Recommended Workflow:**
1. **Work normally** - state auto-saves every 5 minutes
2. **When context ~30%** - Use `/clear` freely
3. **Continue immediately** - `@agent "continue my-feature"`
4. **Full restoration** - All progress, history, and next steps preserved

#### **⚡ Pro Tips:**
```bash
# Create manual checkpoint before major changes
@feature-manager "*save-state my-feature"

# Check feature status anytime
@feature-manager "*check-status my-feature"

# View complete development history
# Read: docs/tasks/my-feature_history.md

# Monitor system health
@feature-manager "*health-check"
```

### 🛡️ **Zero Data Loss Guarantee**
- **IDE crashes** ✅ Full recovery
- **Context overflows** ✅ Seamless continuation  
- **System interruptions** ✅ Complete restoration
- **Agent handoffs** ✅ Perfect state transfer
- **Complex workflows** ✅ Full coordination preserved

### 📈 **State-Based Benefits**
- **30% faster development** - No context management overhead
- **100% crash recovery** - Never lose work again
- **Seamless collaboration** - Share exact state with team
- **Perfect documentation** - Complete audit trail
- **Enterprise reliability** - Production-ready stability

# Or manually create in docs/features/livestream.md
```

### 2. Agent Workflow Chain
```
PO Agent → UI Agent → Cubit Agent → Domain Agent → Data Agent → Security Agent → Test Agent
```

### 3. Status Tracking
Each agent updates the feature status:
```yaml
---

data: open
security: open
test: open
status: in_progress
---
```

### 4. Quality Gates

- **Code Quality**: DRY, SOLID, clean code standards
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 90% coverage requirement
- **Security Compliance**: COPPA and privacy standards
- **Performance**: Optimization and benchmark validation

## 🎯 Feature Development Example

### Creating a Livestream Feature

1. **Create Feature Documentation**:
```markdown
---
name: Livestream
ui: open
domain: open
data: open
security: open
test: open
status: open
---

# Livestream Feature

I want a livestream function like TikTok where users can:
- Swipe up/down to navigate between streams
- Comment via bottom sheet
- Like with animation and counter
- Bookmark streams for later viewing
```

2. **Start Orchestrator**: Load the Orchestrator agent in your IDE
3. **Begin Workflow**: The Orchestrator coordinates all agents automatically
4. **Monitor Progress**: Track status in feature documentation
