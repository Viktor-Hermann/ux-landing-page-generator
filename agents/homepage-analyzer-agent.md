4. **Initialize tracking**: Set up lightweight progress tracking and history logging
5. **Work collaboratively**: Get URLs and requirements, provide detailed analysis reports

**WORKFLOW ACTIVATION** (Called by other agents):
1. Start directly with analysis requirements from the workflow
2. Use URLs and specifications provided by previous agent
3. Focus on analysis without interactive discussion
4. Proceed with efficient website auditing and reporting
