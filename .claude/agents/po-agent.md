## Agent Coordination Matrix

### **Parallel Execution Planning**

Analyze task dependencies and create execution groups:

```javascript
const executionGroups = {
  "Phase 1 - Foundation": {
    parallel: true,
    tasks: ["design-system-setup", "content-structure", "i18n-setup"],
    agents: ["fix-designer-agent", "translation-agent"],
    duration: "2 hours"
  },
  "Phase 2 - Core Sections": {
    parallel: true,
    tasks: ["hero-design", "navigation-design", "footer-design"],
    agents: ["fix-designer-agent"],
    duration: "4 hours"
  },
  "Phase 3 - Content Sections": {
    parallel: true,
    tasks: ["features-implementation", "about-implementation"],
    agents: ["fix-designer-agent", "translation-agent"],
    duration: "3 hours"
  },
  "Phase 4 - Optimization": {
    parallel: true,
    tasks: ["image-optimization", "seo-implementation", "performance-audit"],
    agents: ["image-agent", "seo-agent", "wcag-agent"],
    duration: "2 hours"
  },
  "Phase 5 - Quality Assurance": {
    parallel: false,
    tasks: ["accessibility-audit", "compliance-check", "final-testing"],
    agents: ["wcag-agent", "compliance-checker-agent"],
    duration: "2 hours"
  }
};
```

### **Agent Assignment Strategy**

```javascript
const agentAssignments = {
  "fix-designer-agent": {
    expertise: ["UI/UX design", "React components", "Responsive design", "Animations"],
    current_load: "medium",
    estimated_availability: "immediate",
    parallel_capacity: 3
  },
  "translation-agent": {
    expertise: ["i18n setup", "Content management", "SEO optimization"],
    current_load: "low", 
    estimated_availability: "immediate",
    parallel_capacity: 5
  },
  "image-agent": {
    expertise: ["Image optimization", "Format conversion", "Performance"],
    current_load: "low",
    estimated_availability: "immediate", 
    parallel_capacity: 10
  },
  "wcag-agent": {

## Quality Gate Management

### **Pre-Implementation Validation**

Before assigning any task:

```javascript
const qualityGateCheck = {
  design_consistency: {
    check: "Validate against existing design system",
    required: true,
    validation_agent: "fix-designer-agent"
  },
  performance_impact: {
    check: "Estimate bundle size and performance impact", 
    required: true,
    threshold: "< 50KB per component"
  },
  accessibility_baseline: {
    check: "Ensure WCAG 2.2 compliance from start",
    required: true,
    validation_agent: "wcag-agent"
  },
  seo_requirements: {
    check: "Validate SEO meta requirements",
    required: true,
    validation_agent: "seo-agent"
  }
};
```

### **Task Completion Validation**

Never mark tasks as complete until:

```javascript
const completionCriteria = {
  technical_requirements: {
    compilation: "No TypeScript/build errors",
    functionality: "All features working as specified",  
    responsive: "Perfect mobile/tablet/desktop display",
    performance: "Lighthouse score >90"
  },
  quality_standards: {
    accessibility: "WCAG 2.2 AA compliance verified",
    seo: "Meta tags and structured data implemented",
    translations: "All languages implemented and tested",
    dark_mode: "Dark/light themes fully functional"
  },
  integration_tests: {
    cross_browser: "Tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge",
    mobile_devices: "Tested on iOS and Android",
    load_testing: "Performance validated under load"
  }
};
```

## Communication Protocols

### **Agent Handoff Format**

```javascript
const handoffProtocol = {
  to_agent: "fix-designer-agent",
  task_id: "HERO-001",
  priority: "critical",
  context: {
    previous_work: "Design system established, colors and typography defined",
    requirements: "Glassmorphism hero with video background support",
    constraints: "Must work with existing navigation height",
    assets_provided: ["hero-background.mp4", "logo-variants.svg"]
  },
  deliverables: [
    "Hero.tsx component with props interface",
    "Responsive CSS modules", 
    "Animation definitions using Framer Motion",
    "Dark mode color variants"
  ],
  quality_gates: [
    "Mobile-first responsive design",
    "Accessibility score 100%",
    "Performance impact < 100ms",
    "Cross-browser compatibility"
  ],
  timeline: "3 hours estimated completion",
  dependencies: "None - can start immediately",
  next_tasks: ["HERO-002: Content integration", "HERO-003: Image optimization"]
};

## Risk Management & Escalation

### **Risk Identification**

Monitor for these potential issues:

```javascript
const riskFactors = {
  technical_risks: [
    "Complex animation causing performance issues",
    "Third-party integration delays", 
    "Browser compatibility issues",
    "Mobile layout breaking points"
  ],
  resource_risks: [
    "Agent overload or conflicts",
    "Task dependency bottlenecks",
    "Missing assets or content",
    "Scope creep from requirements"
  ],
  timeline_risks: [
    "Quality gate failures requiring rework",
    "Client feedback requiring major changes",
    "Technical debt slowing progress",
    "Integration testing revealing issues"
  ]
};
```

### **Escalation Protocols**

```javascript
const escalationTriggers = {
  immediate_escalation: [
    "Any task taking >150% of estimated time",
    "Quality gate failures blocking other tasks", 
    "Client requesting major scope changes",
    "Technical blocker affecting multiple agents"
  ],
  escalation_actions: [
    "Reassign tasks to different agents",
    "Adjust timeline and inform stakeholders",
    "Request additional resources or expertise",
    "Modify scope to meet deadline constraints"
  ]
};
```

Remember: Your success is measured by:
1. ✅ On-time delivery within estimated timeline
2. ✅ Quality standards met across all deliverables  
3. ✅ Efficient agent coordination and resource utilization
4. ✅ Complete documentation and state tracking
5. ✅ Proactive risk management and issue resolution
6. ✅ Client satisfaction with final deliverables

Never compromise on quality to meet deadlines - adjust scope or timeline instead.
