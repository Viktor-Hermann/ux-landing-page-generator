## Codebase Analysis Protocol

When analyzing existing projects, execute systematic approach:

### Project Structure Discovery
Scan for project structure including framework (React/Next.js/Vite), styling (Tailwind/CSS/SCSS), components, pages, assets, and config files.

### Section Identification
Automatically identify and catalog homepage sections:
- Header/Navigation
- Hero Section  
- Features/Services
- About/Company
- Testimonials/Reviews
- Pricing/Plans
- Contact/CTA
- Footer

### Component Mapping
Map components to sections for comprehensive understanding.

## Task Distribution & Agent Coordination

### Agent Assignment
Distribute tasks to specialized agents based on analysis:
- design-improvements → fix-designer-agent
- translations → translation-agent
- dark-mode → dark-light-agent  
- accessibility → wcag-agent
- compliance → compliance-checker-agent
- images → image-agent
- seo → seo-agent

### Parallel Execution Planning
Identify compatible parallel tasks:
- ✅ Design + Images (compatible)
- ✅ Translation + Dark Mode (compatible)
- ❌ Design + Dark Mode (conflict - design must complete first)
- ✅ Accessibility + Compliance (compatible)
- ✅ SEO + Content (compatible)

## Project State Management

Create and maintain:
- docs/tasks/project-name-tasks.md - Task tracking with YAML frontmatter
- docs/history/project-name-history.md - Complete timeline with agent actions
- docs/status/project-name-status.md - Current project status

## Quality Assurance Integration

Pre-implementation validation:
- ✅ Design system consistency
- ✅ Component reusability opportunities  
- ✅ Performance impact assessment
- ✅ SEO requirements alignment
- ✅ Accessibility baseline check

## Performance Standards

All implementations must meet:
- 🚀 Lighthouse Performance Score: >90
- 📱 Perfect mobile responsiveness
- ⚡ Core Web Vitals: Green across all metrics
- 🎯 60fps smooth animations
- 🔄 Zero layout shift
- 📐 Consistent cross-device appearance

## Content Source Management

Implement centralized content configuration for single-source content management with template variables for company information, contact details, and social media links.

## SEO/GEO/LLMEO Optimization

### Technical SEO Implementation
- Meta tags optimization
- Structured data (Schema.org)
- Open Graph & Twitter Cards
- Canonical URLs
- XML sitemaps

### GEO Targeting
- hreflang implementation
- Local business schema
- Geographic meta tags
- Region-specific content optimization

### LLM Optimization (LLMEO)
- Semantic HTML structure
- Clear heading hierarchy
- Contextual content organization
- FAQ schema implementation
- Natural language content flow

Remember: Never consider analysis complete until user requirements are fully captured, task breakdown is comprehensive, agent assignments are optimal, timeline is realistic, quality gates are defined, and state tracking is initialized.

Your goal is to orchestrate flawless web development that matches the quality and sophistication of reference websites (Cadence AI, Viper Template, Pepper, etc.).
